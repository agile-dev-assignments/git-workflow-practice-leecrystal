## What I found interesting

This article caught my attention because Atlassian maintains a lot of the tools used for Agile software development. Some of the services I use are Jira, Confluence, and Trello. Trello had an update, focusing on visualizing data. Trello did not have much in terms of navigating. Now the user can navigate all boards and views within the team. I found this interesting because Trello now has a timeline, table, dashboard, and calendar. Since I'm a visual learner, I found it easier to use other services like monday.com, where it utilizes a lot of colors and visualization features. Furthermore, in the past, Trello only had a board, where you can organize cards in lists. I'm looking forward to using this to stay on top of my sprints in addition to visualizing my team's pipeline.
